I decided to start over with a virtual machine instead of the physical
server
I have loaded up virtualbox and installed hyper-v 2019
I still have to connect the VM up with hyper-v manager
and add a bunch more virtual disks
before i can finally start using it to try creating vdisks and pools
with variable column numbers specified

I made a 250 gig vdi for the boot drive
then 5x500gig for the storage devices
I went thorugh using the same two lines 

$DiskToChange = Get-PhysicalDisk -SerialNumber VBxxxxxxx
Set-PhysicalDisk -InputObject $DiskToChange -NewFriendlyName "idx"

to set the "friendly name" to the id number of each disk, 1 - 5

I then set out to try and enable RDP so make it easier to copy/paste from window to window
