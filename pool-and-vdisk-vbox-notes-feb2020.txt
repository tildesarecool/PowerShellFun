I decided to start over with a virtual machine instead of the physical
server
I have loaded up virtualbox and installed hyper-v 2019
I still have to connect the VM up with hyper-v manager
and add a bunch more virtual disks
before i can finally start using it to try creating vdisks and pools
with variable column numbers specified
