# apparently this is comment symbol for powershell
# wanted to go this powershell book back in july 
# but never got to it so here i am doing it in september
# chapter 1 was pretty worthless
# got this command from pg 17
$PSVersionTable

# yep, "intellisense" works in vscode
# Set-Exec

#it would appear in my version of powershell - 5.1.17134.112 -  this command does not exist
# so i guess i do not get "v2 mode" which I likely don't need any way
#Add-WindowsFeature powershell-v2
# looks like the first two chapters of this book could just as easily have been an intro chapter 
# a fraction of the length, but whatever
# I mean you would buy a book called "powershell" but would have to be told it's a 
# "command line interface"? Really?
