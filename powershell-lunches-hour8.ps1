# chapter 8: objectifying powershell
# 
# In PS when using a command like
Get-Process | ConvertTo-Html | Out-File something.html
# the different parts are referred to or o conceptulaized udner different names:
# --> object: represents a single thing such as a single process or a single service; a table row
# --> property: some piece of information about an object such as the the process name, process ID or service status; a table column
# --> method: makes an object do a specific action like killing a process or start a service; relates to a single object
# --> collection: this is a "set" of objects; the whole table
# 
#################################### revealing objects via get-member (gm)
# 
# to learn more about a specific object like get-process you would pipe in
Get-Member
# 
# Get-Member can be used against any cmdlet that produces output, so
Get-Process | Get-Member
# 
# when a cmdlet such as get-process produces a collection of objects - literally just said that's a table - that whole table/collection
# remains accessible until the end of the pipeline. So only after every command has run does PS filters the columns (properties) 
# of information to be displayed and creates the final text output seen on screen
